\question
Describe a scenario in which a force is applied to an object while the work done on the object is zero.

\begin{solution}
    Answers will vary.

    No work is done when the displacement of the object is zero. For example, a person pushes on a large truck that remains stationary, applying a strong force but doing no work on the truck.

\question
The object depicted below has a mass of \SI{3}{kg}.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[x=0.3cm,y=0.3cm]
        \draw[->,thick] (1cm,0.5cm) -- ++(10,0) node[right] {\SI{10}{N}};
        \draw[->,thick] (0,0.5cm) -- ++(-6,0) node[left] {\SI{6}{N}};
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (0,0) rectangle ++(1cm,1cm);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The forces shown last for 6 seconds. What is the object's change in velocity during that time?

\begin{solutionorbox}[3cm]
The net force is

\begin{equation*}
    F_\text{net} = \SI{10}{N} - \SI{6}{N} = \SI{4}{N}
\end{equation*}

The impulse-momentum theorem states

\begin{equation*}
    F_\text{net} \Delta t = \Delta p
\end{equation*}

Plugging in force and time, the change in momentum is

\begin{align*}
    \Delta p &= F_\text{net} \Delta t \\[1ex]
    &= (\SI{4}{N})(\SI{6}{s}) \\[1ex]
    &= \SI{24}{N\cdot s} \\[1ex]
    &= \SI{24}{kg\cdot m/s}
\end{align*}

But change in momentum is

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta p = m \Delta v
\end{equation*}

Therefore, the change in velocity is

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta v = \frac{\Delta p}{m} = \frac{\SI{24}{kg\cdot m/s}}{\SI{3}{kg}} = \boxed{\SI{8}{m/s}}
\end{equation*}
\end{solutionorbox}

\question
Draw a velocity vs time graph for an object traveling with a changing momentum. Explain how the graph shows that momentum is changing.

Answers will vary.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[height=4cm,
            width=4cm,
            ymin=0,ymax=5,
            xmin=0,xmax=3,
            ticks=none,
            axis lines=left,
            ylabel={$v$},
            y label style={rotate=-90},
            xlabel={$t$},
        ]
            \addplot[domain=0:2.5,very thick,black] {1.5*x};
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Momentum is mass multiplied by velocity. So, if velocity is changing, so is momentum.

\question
The average net force shown in the graph below acts on a \SI{12}{kg} object for 9 seconds.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[width=6cm,height=4cm,

            axis lines=left,
            xlabel={Time (s)},
            ylabel={Force (N)},
            y label style={rotate=-90},
            xtick={0,1,...,10},
            ytick={0,1,...,5},
            grid=both,
        ]
            \draw[very thick] (0,4) -- ++(10,0);
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

What is the impulse on the object during this time period?

\begin{solutionorbox}[4cm]
The net force is $F_\text{net} = \SI{4}{N}$ and the time interval is $\Delta t$. Therefore impulse is


\begin{equation*}
    F_\mathrm{net} \Delta t = (\SI{4}{N})(\SI{10}{s}) = \boxed{\SI{40}{N \cdot s}}
\end{equation*}

\end{solutionorbox}

\question
Two identical coffee mugs are dropped from the exact same height. The first mug lands on a concrete floor and breaks. The second mug lands on a pillow and does not break. Using principles learned in this unit on impulse and work, explain why the first coffee mug broke while the second one didn't.

\begin{solution}
    The mugs experience the same change in momentum ($\Delta p$), since they are identical and are dropped from the same height. By the impulse momentum theorem,

    \begin{equation*}
        F_{\mathrm{net}} \Delta t = \Delta p
    \end{equation*}

    each mug experiences a different force and impact time with the surface on which it falls. The mug landing on the pillow took a longer time $\Delta t$ and thus experienced a smaller force $F_\text{net}$. The mug that broke experiences a smaller impact time and thus felt a larger force, which was sufficient to break it.

During that time, what is the direction of the net force? Is the net work done on the ball positive or negative? Explain.

\ifprintanswers
\else
\fillwithlines{3cm}

\begin{solution}
The force is to the right (positive), since the object is accelerating to the right. Defining the rightward direction as positive, there is positive net work on the object.

The velocity vs time graph below shows the motion of a \SI{12}{kg} object.

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

What is the object's change in momentum during this time?

\begin{solutionorbox}[5cm]
According to the graph the object's initial and final velocities are \SI{-10}{m/s} and \SI{15}{m/s}. Therefore, it's change in momentum is

\begin{align*}
    \Delta p &= m \Delta v \\[1ex]
    &= m(v_f - v_i) \\[1ex]
    &= (\SI{12}{kg}) \left(\SI{15}{m/s} - \left(\SI{-10}{m/s}\right)\right) \\[1ex]
    &= \boxed{\SI{300}{kg\cdot m/s}}
\end{align*}
\end{solutionorbox}

\question
A student drops a \SI{3}{kg} textbook from rest from the second floor of the school. If the book reaches a velocity of \SI{11}{m/s} as it hits the ground, what is its change in momentum from the fall?

\begin{solutionorbox}[4cm]
\begin{align*}
    \Delta p &= m \Delta v \\[1ex]
    &= m\left(v_f - v_i\right) \\[1ex]
    &= (\SI{3}{kg})(\SI{11}{m/s} - \SI{0}{m/s}) \\[1ex]
    &= \boxed{\SI{33}{kg\cdot m/s}}
\end{align*}
\end{solutionorbox}

\question
What average net force would need to be applied to an object for \SI{2.0}{s}, in order to change its momentum by \SI{300}{kg\cdot m/s}?

\begin{solutionorbox}[3cm]
By the impulse momentum theorem,

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta p = F_\mathrm{net} \Delta t
\end{equation*}

Therefore,

\begin{equation*}
    F_\mathrm{net} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{\SI{300}{kg\cdot m/s}}{\SI{2.0}{s}} = \boxed{\SI{150}{N}}
\end{equation*}

\begin{solutionorbox}[3cm]
By the work-energy theorem,

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{align*}
    W_\text{net} = \Delta \mathrm{KE} &= \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}m v_i^2 \\[1ex]

\question
The graph below shows the net force on a scooter as a function of time.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[height=5cm,width=6cm,
        axis lines=left,
        ylabel={Net Force (N)},
        xlabel={Time (s)},
        ymin=0,ymax=1000,
        xmin=0,xmax=6,
        ytick={0,200,...,1000},
        xtick={0,1,...,6},
        grid=both,
        minor y tick num=1,
        grid=both
    ]
        \addplot[very thick] (0,0) -- (3,900);   
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

At time $t=0$, the velocity of the scooter is \SI{10}{m/s}. The scooter's mass is \SI{90}{kg}. (a) What is the average force on the scooter during the time interval? (b) Using this average force, calculate the scooter's final velocity.


\begin{solutionorbox}[6cm]
    (a) Since the force starts at 0 and linearly increases to 900, the force must be half of 900, or

    \begin{equation*}
        F_\text{ave} = \SI{450}{N}
    \end{equation*}

(b) The impulse-momentum theorem states

\begin{equation*}
    F_\text{ave} \Delta t = m (v_f - v_i)
\end{equation*}

Solving this equation for the final velocity leads to

\begin{align*}
    v_f &= \frac{F_\text{ave} \Delta t}{m} + v_i \\[1ex]
        &= \frac{(\SI{450}{N})(\SI{3}{s})}{\SI{90}{kg}} + \SI{10}{m/s} \\[1ex]
        &= \boxed{\SI{25}{m/s}}
\end{align*}
