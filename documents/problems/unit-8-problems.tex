\subsubsection{Gravitational and Elastic Potential Energy}

\begin{questions}
\question
Recall Newton's universal law of gravitation:

\begin{equation*}
    F_g = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\end{equation*}

where $G = \SI{6.67e-11}{N\cdot m^2/kg^2}$. Calculate the gravitational force by Earth on a 1.0 kilogram object resting on the surface of Earth. Earth's mass is \SI{5.97e24}{kg}, and the separation distance between Earth and object is Earth's radius, \SI{6.378e8}{m}.

\question
When two masses are separated by some distance, in addition to a mutual force of attraction, there is energy stored in the configuration; we call it gravitational potential energy $E_g$:

Go to \href{https://www.desmos.com/scientific}{desmos.com/scientific}. Define the following variables in each cell:
\vspace{-1em}

\begin{align*}
    & G = \num{6.8139e-11} \\[1ex]
    & m_1 = 1.00 \\[1ex]
    & m_2 = \num{5.97e24} \\[1ex]
    & R = \num{6.378e6} \\[1ex]
    & h = 0 
\end{align*}

where $G$ is a slightly modified\footnote{Setting $G = \num{6.814e-11}$ makes $g = 10$.} version of the universal gravitational constant, $m_1$ is a test mass (like a bowling ball), $m_2$ is the mass of the Earth in kilograms, $r$ is the Earth's radius in meters, and $h$ is the vertical position of the object relative to the surface of the Earth (i.e., the height above ground). 

Next, define the initial and final gravitational potential energy between the Earth and test mass as

\begin{align*}
    E_i &= -\frac{G m_1 m_2}{R} \\[1ex]
    E_f &= - \frac{G m_1 m_2}{R+h}
\end{align*}

where the term $r+h$ represents the Earth's radius plus the height to which the object has been raised.

Finally, define the \textit{change} in gravitational potential energy as

\begin{equation*}
    E_{\mathrm{change}} = E_f - E_i
\end{equation*}

\begin{questions}
\question
Suppose a 1-kilogram object is launched vertically upwards at \SI{18}{m/s}. Make a graph of the object's kinetic energy vs. time, gravitational potential energy vs. time, and total mechanical energy vs. time, as follows. Go to \href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator}{desmos.com/calculator}. Enter the following variables and equations in each cell:

\begin{align*}
    & m = 1 \\[1ex]
    & g = 10 \\[1ex]
    & v_0 = 18 \\[1ex]
    & v(t) = v_0 - gt \\[1ex]
    & K(t) = \frac{1}{2} m v\left(t\right)^2 \\[1ex]
    & h(t) = v_0 t - \frac{1}{2}g t^2 \\[1ex]
    & P(t) = mg h(t) \\[1ex]
    & E(t) = K(t) + P(t)
\end{align*}

where $m$ is mass, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, $v_0$ is the initial speed, $v(t)$ is the velocity as a function of time $t$, $K(t)$ is kinetic energy as a function of time, $h(t)$ is the vertical displacement, $P(t)$ is gravitational potential energy, and $E(t)$ is total mechanical energy.

\textbf{Disable} the graphs for $v(t)$ and $h(t)$ so that only $K(t)$, $P(t)$, and $E(t)$ are visible. Then click the graph settings (\faWrench) and set the X-Axis and Y-Axis limits to

\begin{equation*}
    0 \leq x \leq 4 \qquad \text{and} \qquad
    0 \leq y \leq 180
